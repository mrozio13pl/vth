# Quickstart

The easiest way to create a vth project is with the [create-vth](https://npm.im/create-vth) CLI:

```sh
pnpm create vth
```

Then follow the prompts.

Once you have created your project you can `cd` into it and run the development server:

```sh
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

This will start Vite dev server you can visit at [`localhost:5173`](http://localhost:5173).
It handles all client and API requests as well as hot refreshing for both frontend and backend.

## First build

To build your project simply run the `build` script:

```sh
npm run build
# or
yarn build
# or
pnpm build
# or
bun build
```

It will execute two Vite build commands to first build the client and then the server.
You can then run the app just by simply executing the main entry which should be located in `./dist/index.js`.
