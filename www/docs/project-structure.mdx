# Project structure

After you initialized your project, the structure should look something like this:

```md
.
├── app/                    # React frontend
│    ├── index.tsx          # Main frontend entry
│    └── pages/             # Pages
├── components/             # Components
│    └── ui/                # Components from Shadcnui
├── lib/                    # For shared utilities
│    ├── auth.ts            # Backend auth logic
│    ├── auth-client.ts     # Frontend auth logic
│    ├── client.ts          # Hono's tRPC
│    ├── database.ts        # Database logic
│    ├── schemas.ts         # Place for your schemas
│    ├── types.ts           # Shared types

## Stack

### Recommended extensions (for VSCode)

- [UnoCSS](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=antfu.unocss) - UnoCSS autocomplete
- [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) - JavaScript/TypeScript linter

### Build tool

This template is centered around [Vite](https://vite.dev/) as it's very flexible and hackable, providing good DX while  simultaneously handling client and server.

#### Why VIte?

- Way more performant with [rolldown](https://rolldown.rs/) (replacement for esbuild and rollup) than bundlers like webpack
- Very customizable when it comes to complex apps
- Versatile for stuff like PWA, different frameworks, in our case a seperate SMTP server and customizable build outputs
- Rich of plugins making it easy to extend the app

### Frontend

The frontend is built with [React](https://react.dev/), but it shouldn't be difficult to switch to another one you prefer.

#### Routing

Routing is made with [vite-plugin-pages](https://github.com/hannoeru/vite-plugin-pages) and [react-router](https://reactrouter.com/) which is configured to mimic Next.js-like frontend experience.

#### Styling

CSS is mostly done with [UnoCSS](https://unocss.dev/), a flexible atomic CSS engine, basically a more extensible, un-opinionated alternative to [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

[LightningCSS](https://lightningcss.dev/) is used for CSS minification.

Style reset comes from [Eric Meyer CSS Reset](https://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/index.html) provided by [@unocss/reset](https://unocss.dev/guide/style-reset).

#### UI Components

- [Radix UI](https://radix-ui.com/) - Accessible, unstyled component primitives
- [Lucide](https://lucide.dev/) - Community-backed SVG icon library

### Backend

The backend is build with [Hono](https://hono.dev/) and its [Vite plugins](https://github.com/honojs/vite-plugins).

#### Why Hono?

- Easy to understand and integrate with Vite
- Very customizable and extendable
- Type-safe and has RPC client out of the box
