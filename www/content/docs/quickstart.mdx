# Getting started

The easiest way to create a vth project is with the [create-vth](https://npm.im/create-vth) CLI:

<Steps>

<Step>

### Create vth project

Run the following command for your package manager:

```npm title="Terminal"
npm create vth
```

Then follow the prompts.

</Step>

<Step>

### Start the development server

Once you have created your project you can `cd` into it and run the development server:

```npm title="Terminal"
npm run dev
```

This will start Vite dev server you can visit at [`localhost:5173`](http://localhost:5173).
It handles all client and API requests as well as hot refreshing for both frontend and backend.

</Step>

<Step>

### First build

To build your project simply run the `build` script:

```npm title="Terminal"
npm run build
```

It will execute two Vite build commands to first build the client and then the server.
You can then run the app just by simply executing the main entry which should be located in `./dist/index.js`.

</Step>

</Steps>

## Manual setup

If you prefer not to use the CLI, you can manually setup your project with [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit):

<Steps>

<Step>

### Clone the template

Clone the template from the repository:

```npm title="Terminal"
npx degit mrozio13pl/vth/templates/full
```

</Step>

<Step>

### Rename .gitignore

Make sure `.gitignore` is working as expected:

```sh title="Terminal"
rename _gitignore .gitignore
```

</Step>

<Step>

### Install dependencies

```npm title="Terminal"
npm install
```

</Step>

<Step>

### Start the development server

You can now start the development server:

```npm title="Terminal"
npm run dev
```

</Step>
