## Introduction to RSC

[RSC](https://react.dev/reference/react-server-components) allows you to build server-rendered components that can be used on the server and in the client.

[@vitejs/plugin-rsc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/tree/main/packages/plugin-rsc) is an official Vite plugin that allows you to use and customize RSC in Vite.

### Why?

RSC is a great way to offload complex and heavy logic to the server, reduce bundle size and improve performance.

### Benefits

- smaller client bundle size and load time
- faster initial load time
- direct access to server from client
- better code organization and structure
