## Server

The backend is written in [Hono](https://hono.dev/), a lightweight and fast web framework.

### Why Hono?

Hono is a fast, clean, lightweight and easy to use backend framework. It works great especially in a shared codebase with its type-safe routes and RPC client out of the box.

Hono also provides [plugins](https://github.com/honojs/vite-plugins) for Vite, which makes it easy to use with Vite.

### How to use it in vth?

The backend in stored in `server/index.tsx`, it handles both routes and serves client files.

```ts title="server/index.tsx"
/** @jsxImportSource hono/jsx */

import { Hono } from 'hono';
import { serveStatic } from '@hono/node-server/serve-static';
import { rsc } from '~rsc';

const app = new Hono();

const api = new Hono();

app.route('/api', api);

if (import.meta.env.PROD) {
    app.get('/*', serveStatic({ root: './dist/client' }));
}

app.get('/*', (c) => rsc(c.req.raw)); // handling frontend requests

export type App = typeof api; // for hono client

export default app;
```

> This example only serves client files.

#### Adding routes

The easiest way to add a route is to create a file inside `server/routes` directory. The file should export a `Hono` router and be named after the route.

```ts title="server/routes/example.ts"
import { Hono } from 'hono';

export const exampleRouter = new Hono()
    .get('/', (c) => c.text('example route'))
    .post('/', (c) => c.text('example route'));
```

<Callout type='warn'>
    To insure tRPC works as expected, every route must be defined in a single chain expression.
</Callout>

This approach would break tRPC:

```ts title="server/routes/example.ts"
import { Hono } from 'hono';

const exampleRouter = new Hono()

exampleRouter.get('/', (c) => c.text('example route')); // [!code --]
exampleRouter.post('/', (c) => c.text('example route')); // [!code --]

export { exampleRouter };
```

Now add it to `server/index.tsx`:

```ts title="server/index.tsx"
import { Hono } from 'hono';
import { exampleRouter } from './routes/example';

const app = new Hono()

const api = new Hono()
    .route('/example', exampleRouter); // [!code ++]

// ...
```
