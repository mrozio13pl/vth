## Client

The frontend is written in [React](https://react.dev/).

### Why React?

React is a popular library for building user interfaces, it's fast, flexible and has a large ecosystem built around it.

### Routing

Routing is made with [vite-plugin-pages](https://github.com/hannoeru/vite-plugin-pages) and [react-router](https://reactrouter.com/) which is configured to mimic Next.js-like frontend experience.

<Files>
    <Folder name="app" defaultOpen>
        <File icon={<SiReact />} name="index.tsx" defaultOpen />
        <Folder name="pages" defaultOpen>
            <File icon={<SiReact />} name="index.tsx" />
            <File icon={<SiReact />} name="example.tsx" />
        </Folder>
    </Folder>
</Files>

- `app/index.tsx` is the main entry point for the app
- `app/pages/index.tsx` is the home page
- `app/pages/example.tsx` is the example page which can be accessed via `/example` in the browser

### tRPC

tRPC comes from [Hono's RPC](https://hono.dev/docs/guides/rpc).

```ts title="lib/client.ts"
import { hc } from 'hono/client';
import type { App } from '@/server';

export const client = hc<App>('/api');
```

You can combine it with [React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/):

```tsx
import { useQuery } from '@tanstack/react-query';
import { client } from '@/lib/client';

const { data: todos, isLoading, refetch } = useQuery({
    queryKey: ['example'],
    queryFn: async () => {
        const res = await client.example.$get();
        return res.json();
    },
});
```

### Forms

You can use [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/) to handle forms.

> I recommend using [valibot](https://valibot.dev) to validate your forms.

### Performance

For monitoring performance issues on the client in development, [React Scan](https://react-scan.com/) is a tool that helps you identify them without having to do any code changes.

The script is injected in the [backend](/docs/guides/backend/server#how-to-use-it-in-vth).
