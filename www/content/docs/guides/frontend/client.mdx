## Client

The frontend is written in [React](https://react.dev/).

### Why React?

React is a popular library for building user interfaces, it's fast, flexible and has a large ecosystem built around it.

### tRPC

tRPC comes from [Hono's RPC](https://hono.dev/docs/guides/rpc).

```ts title="lib/client.ts"
import { hc } from 'hono/client';
import type { App } from '@/server';

export const client = hc<App>('/api');
```

You can combine it with [React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/):

```tsx
import { useQuery } from '@tanstack/react-query';
import { client } from '@/lib/client';

const { data: todos, isLoading, refetch } = useQuery({
    queryKey: ['example'],
    queryFn: async () => {
        const res = await client.example.$get();
        return res.json();
    },
});
```

### Forms

You can use [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/) to handle forms.

> I recommend using [valibot](https://valibot.dev) to validate your forms.

### Performance

For monitoring performance issues on the client in development, [React Scan](https://react-scan.com/) is a tool that helps you identify them without having to do any code changes.

The script is injected in the root layout of the app only in development:

```tsx title="components/react-scan.tsx"
'use client';

// react-scan must be imported before react
import { scan } from 'react-scan';
import { type JSX, useEffect } from 'react';

export function ReactScan(): JSX.Element {
    useEffect(() => {
        scan({
            enabled: true,
        });
    }, []);

    return <></>;
}
```

```tsx title="app/layout.tsx"
import { ReactScan } from '@/components/react-scan'; // [!code ++]
// ...

export default function Root({ children }: LayoutProps) {
    return (
        <html lang="en" suppressHydrationWarning>
            <head>
                {/* ... */}
                {import.meta.env.DEV && <ReactScan />}
            </head>
            {/* ... */}
        </html>
    );
}
```
