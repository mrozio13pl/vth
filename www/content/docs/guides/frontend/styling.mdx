## CSS

The frontend uses [UnoCSS](https://unocss.dev/) for styling, a flexible and extensible CSS engine.

> UnoCSS is a replacement for TailwindCSS and serves as a more extensible, unopinionated alternative.

## Components

The popular and modern solution for UI components is [Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/) and [Radix UI](https://radix-ui.com/). It's a collection of ready-to-use components that can be customized to fit your needs. They're for the most part styled with [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) but can also be used with UnoCSS without many issues.

### Icons

Icons are made with [Lucide](https://lucide.dev/), a community-backed SVG icon library.

### Themes

You can easily switch between light and dark mode with [next-themes](https://github.com/pacocoursey/next-themes).

You can also use [unocss-preset-shadcn](https://unocss-preset-shadcn.vercel.app/) to switch between many color schemes for Shadcn UI.

## Fonts

The easiest way to use fonts is with [Fontsource](https://fontsource.org/). It provides open source fonts in NPM packages.
