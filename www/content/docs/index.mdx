# What's vth?

__vth__ is a TypeScript full-stack template designed to provide the best developer experience.
It is centered around [Vite](https://vite.dev/), a fast web build tool.
Because Vite is very hackable and flexible, it can be used to serve both frontend and backend simultaneously
without the need to work with complex parallel scripts.

### Features

- **Shared codebase**: Server and Client code easily integrated in a single project. No need for a monorepo!
- **Fully type-safe**: Guaranteed type-safety with Hono's tRPC and Kysely query builder.
- **Control**: Easily configurable with Vite. Use plugins for Vite and Rollup.
- **Performant**: Fast-driven development and build time with Rolldown.
- **Pages and layouts**: Built-in routing and layout support with RSC.

### Why?

I wanted an easy and predictable setup for NodeJS to have a server and a client in the same codebase.
While I understand why you would want to use something like a monorepo,
I find it sometimes difficult to work in a monorepo, because you need to configure it,
setup all scripts, shared configs and even then it's not really suitable for a web application
as you need to constantly switch between the client and server files, navigating thru the entire
monorepo just to get to the server/client/shared package is not ideal. However, the most annoying bit
is actually sharing the code by a package, usually something like `shared` package.
